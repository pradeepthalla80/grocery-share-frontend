# Recent Changes (November 7, 2025)

## Current Session: Backend Updates Ready to Deploy (November 7, 2025)

### Status: ⏳ Waiting for Backend Updates

**Frontend:** ✅ Fully deployed on Vercel  
**Backend:** 📋 Complete code ready to copy-paste into GitHub

### Frontend Features Ready:
- ✅ Modern chat interface with circular avatars
- ✅ Gmail OAuth profile fetch from `/users/me`
- ✅ Admin dashboard with role-based access
- ✅ All code pushed to GitHub and deployed to Vercel

### Backend Changes Needed:
The frontend is calling these endpoints that need to be added to the backend:

**Location:** GitHub repository `https://github.com/pradeepthalla80/grocery-share-backend`

**5 Files to Add/Update:**

1. **`models/User.js`** - Add `role` field with enum ['user', 'admin', 'super_admin']
2. **`middleware/admin.js`** (NEW FILE) - Admin authentication middleware
3. **`routes/users.js`** (NEW FILE) - User profile endpoint
4. **`routes/admin.js`** (NEW FILE) - Platform admin endpoints
5. **`index.js`** - Register new routes

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /users/me` - Fetch authenticated user profile with role
- `GET /admin/items` - All items platform-wide (admin only)
- `GET /admin/requests` - All requests platform-wide (admin only)
- `GET /admin/stats` - Platform statistics (admin only)

**Complete implementation code provided to user.**

### Next Steps:
1. Copy-paste backend code into GitHub
2. Push to GitHub
3. Render auto-deploys within 1-2 minutes
4. Update a user's role to 'super_admin' via MongoDB
5. Logout and login to get new JWT with admin role
6. Test admin dashboard and Gmail OAuth

### Important Note:
This Replit workspace contains **ONLY the frontend code**. The backend code lives in a separate GitHub repository and is deployed directly to Render. The workspace name "grocery-share-backend" is misleading—it actually contains the frontend.

## Previous Session: Modern Chat Interface Redesign + OAuth Fix

### Split-View Messaging Experience
Complete redesign of the chat interface with clean, scannable message list and modern chat window.

**What Was Changed:**
1. **Messages List (Left Panel)**:
   - Single-line compact rows similar to Dashboard items
   - Circular avatars (item image or gradient user icon)
   - Each row displays: avatar, sender name, relative timestamp, item name, and last message preview
   - All information fits on one line for quick scanning
   - Selected conversation highlighted with green left border
   - Smooth hover states and transitions

2. **Chat Window (Right Panel)**:
   - Modern rounded message bubbles with subtle shadows
   - Gradient backgrounds for visual depth
   - Cleaner header with circular avatar
   - Rounded input field with improved styling
   - Different bubble shapes for sender/receiver (rounded corners)

3. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Relative timestamps ("2 minutes ago") for better context
   - Better visual hierarchy and spacing
   - Responsive design (fixed width on larger screens)
   - Improved empty states with helpful CTAs

**Files Changed:**
- `src/pages/Chat.tsx` - Complete chat interface redesign

**Features Preserved:**
- ✅ Real-time message polling (3s for messages, 5s for conversations)
- ✅ Auto-scroll to latest message (unless user scrolls up manually)
- ✅ Reveal Address and Confirm Pickup buttons
- ✅ Rating modal integration
- ✅ Mark messages as read functionality
- ✅ New conversation handling from URL parameters

**Architect Review:** ✅ Passed
- Clean single-line scannable message rows
- Modern chat window design
- No functionality broken
- No performance concerns
- TypeScript types correct

### Gmail OAuth User Name Fix

**Issue Fixed:** Users logging in with Gmail OAuth were showing as "User" instead of their actual Google name.

**Solution:** Updated OAuth callback to fetch full user profile from backend `/users/me` endpoint after receiving token, ensuring real name and complete user data (including admin role) is loaded.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx` - Now fetches user profile from backend

**How it works:**
1. Receive OAuth token from Google callback
2. Save token to enable authenticated API calls
3. Fetch complete user profile from `/users/me` endpoint
4. Use backend data (includes Google name, role, etc.)
5. Fallback to URL params if profile fetch fails

**Architect Review:** ✅ Passed
- OAuth flow works correctly
- Real user name fetched from backend
- Admin roles preserved
- Proper error handling and fallback

---

## Previous Session: Role-Based Admin System

### New Admin/Super Admin Functionality
Complete role-based access control system for platform moderation and management.

**What Was Added:**
1. **User Roles**: `user` (default), `admin`, and `super_admin` roles
2. **Admin Dashboard**: New `/admin` route with platform overview and management
3. **Admin Controls**: Delete buttons on item and request detail pages (admin-only)
4. **Admin Navigation**: Purple "Admin" link in navbar (visible only to admins)
5. **Admin Utilities**: `useAdmin` hook and permission checking functions
6. **Documentation**: Complete ADMIN_SETUP.md guide for backend integration

**Files Changed:**
- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Added role field to User interface
- `src/hooks/useAdmin.ts` - New hook for admin permission checks
- `src/utils/adminUtils.ts` - Admin utility functions
- `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Admin dashboard page
- `src/pages/ItemDetail.tsx` - Added admin delete button
- `src/pages/RequestDetail.tsx` - Added admin delete button
- `src/components/Navbar.tsx` - Added admin link for admins
- `src/App.tsx` - Added admin route
- `ADMIN_SETUP.md` - Complete setup and integration guide

**Backend Requirements:**
⚠️ Admin system requires backend support to function fully:
- Update User model with `role` field ('user' | 'admin' | 'super_admin')
- Include `role` in JWT tokens and login responses
- Create admin middleware for protected endpoints
- **Required endpoints for dashboard:**
  - `GET /admin/items` - Get all items platform-wide
  - `GET /admin/requests` - Get all requests platform-wide
  - `GET /admin/stats` - Get platform statistics
  - `DELETE /items/:id` - Allow admin delete with elevated permissions
  - `DELETE /requests/:id` - Allow admin delete with elevated permissions

**Current Limitations (until backend is updated):**
- Admin Dashboard shows only admin's own items/requests (not platform-wide data)
- Delete operations may require backend permission updates
- Statistics are incomplete without admin endpoints

**How to Make a User Admin:**
See ADMIN_SETUP.md for detailed instructions. Quickest method:
```javascript
// MongoDB direct update
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "admin@example.com" },
  { $set: { role: "super_admin" } }
);
```
Then logout and login to get new JWT with role.

**Architect Review:** ✅ Passed
- Permission checks are sound
- UI only shows for authorized users
- Delete functions have proper confirmations
- TypeScript types are correct
- No security issues detected
- Documentation is comprehensive
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Previous Session: Button Visibility & OAuth Fixes

### Issues Fixed
1. **Buy Now button missing** - Payment integration wasn't visible on ItemDetail page
2. **Contact Seller section missing** - Chat option only showed for available items
3. **Gmail OAuth login failing** - 404 error calling non-existent /users/me endpoint
4. **TypeScript type errors** - Item interface missing status and buyerId fields

### Changes Made

**src/api/items.ts**
- Added `status?: 'available' | 'sold' | 'refunded'` field to Item interface
- Added `buyerId?: string` field to Item interface
- Fixes TypeScript errors when accessing item.status and item.buyerId

**src/pages/ItemDetail.tsx**
- Fixed Buy Now button visibility: Shows for paid, available, non-owned items
- Fixed Contact Seller section: Now shows for ALL non-owned items (regardless of status)
- Fixed Interested to Buy button: Shows for available items only
- Updated all visibility conditions to handle undefined status (defaults to 'available')
- Removed type casting `(item as any)` in favor of proper typed access

**src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx**
- Removed dependency on missing `/users/me` endpoint
- Now reads user data from OAuth callback URL parameters: token, userId, name, email
- Backend must send these parameters in OAuth redirect URL

**src/pages/RequestDetail.tsx**
- Interested to Offer button verified working for active requests
- Uses proper type definitions

### Architect Review
✅ All changes reviewed and approved
- Button visibility logic handles edge cases properly

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with **React 19** and **TypeScript** using **Vite 7** for fast development. **React Router v7** handles client-side navigation.

**UI & Styling**: **Tailwind CSS v4** with custom design tokens, **Lucide React** for iconography, and **Class Variance Authority (CVA)** for component variants.

**State Management**: Primarily uses **React Context API** for global state (Authentication, Notifications, Toast messages) and React hooks for local component state.

**Form Handling**: **React Hook Form v7** is integrated with **Zod v4** for robust form validation and schema definition.

**Authentication**: **JWT-based** authentication supporting email/password and **Google OAuth**. Tokens are stored in `localStorage` and automatically injected into Axios requests. Protected routes ensure secure access.

**Map Integration**: **Leaflet v1.9** with **React-Leaflet v5** provides interactive maps, utilizing **OpenStreetMap** tiles and **Nominatim** for geocoding.

**Real-time Features**: Achieved through polling for chat messages (5-second intervals) and notifications, with unread counts and toast notifications for user feedback.

**Image Management**: Supports multi-image uploads (up to 5 per item) with **Cloudinary** integration for hosting and optimization.

## Backend Integration

**API Communication**: **Axios** is used for HTTP requests, configured with a base URL and automatic JWT token injection. Global error handling includes a 401 redirect to login.

**API Structure**: The frontend interacts with a RESTful API, organized into modules for authentication, items, chat, notifications, item requests, recommendations, ratings, gamification, payments, address management, and contact forms.

## Data Models

Core entities include **User**, **Item**, **Message**, **Conversation**, **Notification**, **ItemRequest**, **Rating**, and **Badge**. Location handling prioritizes privacy, with addresses hidden until mutual consent.

## Routing Structure

**Public Routes**: `/login`, `/register`, `/auth/callback`, `/terms`, `/privacy`, `/contact`.
**Protected Routes**: `/dashboard`, `/my-items`, `/add-item`, `/edit-item/:id`, `/chat`, `/item-requests`, `/profile`.
Route protection is managed by a `ProtectedRoute` component that redirects unauthenticated users.

## Key Features

**Search & Discovery**: Location-based search with radius filtering, keyword, category, and tag filtering, personalized recommendations, and trending items.
**Listing Management**: Multi-image upload, address autocomplete with map preview, flexible pricing (free/paid), pickup time windows, and category/tag organization.
**Communication**: One-on-one messaging, conversation threads, unread indicators, real-time polling, and an address reveal mechanism.
**Gamification**: Badge system for achievements and a user rating/review system.
**Safety & Privacy**: Addresses are hidden by default, requiring mutual consent for revealing, and a pickup confirmation workflow.
