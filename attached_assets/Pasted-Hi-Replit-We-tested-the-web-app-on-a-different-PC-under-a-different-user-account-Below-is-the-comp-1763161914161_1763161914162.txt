Hi Replit,
We tested the web app on a different PC under a different user account.
Below is the complete and updated bug list.
Please let me know if you prefer to fix everything together or one-by-one.

⸻

1️⃣ Search – “No Items Found” Message Too Low on Page

When searching and no items match, the “item not found” message appears only at the bottom after scrolling.

➡️ Please move this message to the middle of the results area, so users see it immediately.

⸻

2️⃣ “Use Current Location” Works on My Devices but Not on Another PC

On my PC and phone, current location works.
On another test PC, nothing happens and no address is filled.

➡️ Please review:
	•	Permission handling across browsers
	•	Fallback logic
	•	Proper error prompt if location is denied or blocked

⸻

3️⃣ Add Item – Image Preview Shows as Black Box

When adding an item:
	•	The image preview box displays as a black box during upload
	•	After saving, the image displays correctly everywhere (dashboard, search results, My Items)

➡️ Only fix the preview rendering on the Add Item page.
(Screenshots available if needed.)

⸻

4️⃣ Add Item – Internal Server Error

On the test PC, submitting a new item sometimes results in “Internal server error.”

➡️ Please log and identify the backend cause, and handle gracefully in UI.

⸻

5️⃣ Address Formatting Issues in Request Posting

This issue happens for all manually entered addresses.

When posting a request with an address like:
“3572 Hidden Fawn Drive, Elgin, Illinois, 60124, United States”

The app:
	1.	Shows “Failed to find address”
	2.	Auto-fills with something like:

“3572 Hidden Fawn Drive, Elgin, Plato Township, Kane County, Illinois, 60124, United States”

Problems:
	•	“Plato Township” is inserted automatically
	•	House number disappears in some cases
	•	Address format becomes too long / inconsistent

➡️ Please ensure:
	•	House number always preserved
	•	No unnecessary administrative regions inserted
	•	Address normalization is consistent and predictable

⸻

6️⃣ Request Section – Cannot See Others’ Requests Without Posting One

Currently, users cannot view other users’ requests unless they first create their own request.

➡️ All public requests should be visible by default.

⸻

7️⃣ Messages – Failed to Send

Messages fail to send on the test PC.
Users type → click send → message does not send and fails.

➡️ Please debug:
	•	API or websocket sending
	•	Messaging permissions for new accounts
	•	Error handling on frontend

⸻

8️⃣ Adding an Item Logs the User Out

After submitting an item, the app sometimes logs out the user.

➡️ Possibly related to:
	•	Token refresh
	•	Auth middleware
	•	Error response handling

Please ensure item submission never triggers logout.

⸻

9️⃣ Ratings Not Updating on Search Results

When a user receives a rating:
	•	The rating updates correctly in the user’s profile
	•	But the rating does NOT update on search results / dashboard listings

Expected:
	•	Ratings should appear consistently wherever the item or store appears.

➡️ Please sync ratings across:
	•	Dashboard
	•	Search results
	•	Item details
	•	Store items view

⸻

📎 Screenshots Available

I can provide visual references for:
	•	Black image preview
	•	Address auto-fill behavior
	•	Any error screens

⸻

❓ Question

Do you prefer:
	1.	Fix all bugs in one batch (then I perform full regression)
or
	2.	Fix one-by-one with validation after each?
