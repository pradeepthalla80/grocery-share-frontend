🛠️
– Thank you for all your great work so far!
As we're moving closer to production, I’ve tested the latest build and noticed a few enhancements and bugs that need addressing. Please see below, grouped by feature areas, with clarified logic and expected behaviors:
________________________________________
1. 🏠 Dashboard Enhancements
Current Issues:
•	Dashboard isn't showing items consistently.
•	Default results aren’t sorted clearly or grouped.
•	Clicking an item skips detail view.
Requests:
•	Show latest Available Items and Requested Items by default when the user logs in.
•	Use location-based sorting (by ZIP code or user-entered address).
•	Display in two tabs or sections:
o	🔹 Available Items
o	🔹 Requested Items
•	Each item card should display:
o	Image(s)
o	Title / short description
o	Time left (till expiration)
o	Distance from user
o	Clickable link to open the Item Detail Page (→ NOT direct chat)
🔍 Search Filters Enhancements:
•	Add filter options:
o	✅ Available Items
o	✅ Requested Items
o	✅ Both (default if none selected)
•	Add category dropdown (if implemented).
Logic:
If the user does not select “Available” or “Requested,” the system should return both item types, filtered by any other keywords or category.

2. 📦 Item/Request Detail Page – UX Improvements
Current Issue:
•	Clicking an item/request directly opens chat without showing details.
Updated Request (As per your new instruction):
When any item or request is clicked, it should first open a dedicated item detail page showing:
•	✅ Full description
•	✅ All images (with zoom functionality)
•	✅ Expiration date
•	✅ Distance from user
•	✅ Availability timeframe or pickup time window
•	✅ Price of the item (if applicable)
Additional Elements on the Page:
•	“🔓 Reveal Address” button – appears only after both parties agree
•	“📩 Contact Provider” section:
o	Ask a question
o	Optional Start Chat (user-controlled, not auto-triggered)
Important:
Currently, users who post item requests have no way to edit or delete their request. Please implement Edit and Delete options for item requests — same workflow as regular item posts.

3. 🔔 Notifications & Alerts
Current Issues:
•	Notification bell icon is non-functional.
•	No alerts when someone responds to a post or request.
Requests:
•	Enable in-app notifications via bell icon.
•	Alert users when:
o	New message is received
o	Someone responds to their item or request
o	Pickup is confirmed
•	Optional: Add email notifications (if user opted in)
________________________________________
4. 🗃️ Item Request Handling (Symmetry with Listings)
Current Issue:
•	Item requests behave differently from item listings and feel disconnected.
Requests:
•	Treat item requests just like listings.
•	Clicking a request should open detail view first (not chat), including:
o	Title, description
o	Requester location (approximate)
o	Desired pickup window
o	Optional category
•	Users offering an item should click “Offer This Item” → opens contact form/chat
•	Notify requester of offer
•	Once both sides confirm → reveal address
•	Allow requester to edit/delete request (same as listing)

5. 🔐 Login & Authentication Fixes
Current Issues:
•	Fake or invalid emails are accepted
•	Google login has noticeable delays
Requests:
•	Add email format validation
•	(Optional) Add email verification via confirmation link
•	Prevent dummy/test emails (e.g., test@test.com)
•	Add spinner/loading animation after Google login while dashboard loads
________________________________________
6. 🧭 Navigation & Menu Behavior
Current Issue:
•	Top menu bar becomes non-functional on certain pages (e.g., Add Item)
Requests:
•	Make the top nav menu always sticky and clickable
•	From any page, user should be able to navigate to:
o	Dashboard
o	Messages
o	Add Item
o	Profile
•	Fix scrolling bug where message/chat windows interfere with nav access
________________________________________
7. 💬 Messaging UI Improvements
Current Issues:
•	Messages load without thread view
•	Message view scroll hijacks page
•	No clear entry/exit from chats
Requests:
•	Show message threads by user when entering Messages
•	Clicking a thread → opens full conversation
•	Fix scroll bug (don’t force auto-scroll)
•	Add auto-scroll only when a new message is received
•	Add basic options like:
o	Reply
o	Mark read/unread
________________________________________
8. ⭐ Ratings & User Feedback
Current Issue:
•	Users can’t submit or view ratings
•	No rating summary shown
Requests:
•	Fix bug that blocks rating submissions
•	After confirmed pickup → trigger rating modal
•	Show average rating (1–5 stars) next to usernames in:
o	Item listings
o	Chat conversations
o	Profile pages
