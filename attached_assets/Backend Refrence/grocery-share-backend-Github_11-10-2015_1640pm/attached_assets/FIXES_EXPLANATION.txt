## EXPLANATIONS & FIXES:

### ✅ Issue #1: Dashboard Not Showing Items by Default
**Problem:** Dashboard required manual location selection before showing ANY items.
**Root Cause:** Missing auto-location feature on page load.
**FIX APPLIED:** Added automatic geolocation that:
- Gets your current location when page loads
- Automatically searches for nearby items
- Falls back to default location if geolocation denied

### ⚠️ Issue #2: Post Request Failing  
**Need More Info:** What error message do you see when adding an item?
- Does it say "validation error"?
- Does it say "network error"?
- What happens after you click "Add Item"?

### ⚠️ Issue #3: Images Not Showing
**Need Screenshot:** Can you show me exactly what the image problem looks like?
- Are images completely blank?
- Do they show broken image icon?
- Do they load slowly then disappear?

### ✅ Issue #4: Contact Seller Button "Missing"
**This is CORRECT BEHAVIOR:**
- You WON'T see "Contact Seller" on YOUR OWN items (that would be messaging yourself!)
- You WILL see "Contact Seller" on OTHER users' items
- **To Test:** Create a second test account, post an item, then view it from your main account

### ✅ Issue #5: Message Section Browse Button
**This is CORRECT BEHAVIOR:**
- When you have NO conversations, it shows "Browse Items" button
- This guides you to Dashboard to find items
- Once you click "Contact Seller" on an item, a conversation starts
- **To Test:** Find someone else's item → Click "Contact Seller" → Send message → Check Messages page

## WHAT I'VE FIXED:
✅ Dashboard now auto-loads items when you first visit
✅ Backend sorting works (newest first)
✅ Search enhanced (partial matching)

## WHAT NEEDS YOUR INPUT:
❓ Post request error - need exact error message
❓ Image problem - need screenshot of what you see
