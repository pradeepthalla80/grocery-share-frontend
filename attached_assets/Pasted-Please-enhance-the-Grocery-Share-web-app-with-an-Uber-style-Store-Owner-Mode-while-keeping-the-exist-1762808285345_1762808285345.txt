Please enhance the Grocery Share web app with an Uber-style Store Owner Mode while keeping the existing architecture intact, and add a complete Store Owner Terms & Agreement system for legal compliance and recordkeeping.

🔹 Main Goals

Add a Store Owner Mode so verified users can create and manage their own mini-stores inside the app.

Display store items together with community-shared items in the same dashboard and search pages—no separate section.

Clearly mark store items with a visible “Store Item” badge, a small 🛒 icon, and show quantity and price.

Add a filter toggle — “Show Only Store Items.”

Let store owners switch modes with a “Switch to Store Mode” button, manage inventory (add / edit / delete items, adjust stock, review Stripe transactions), and automatically tag their listings as store items.

Keep existing chat, payment, location, and request features fully compatible with store items.

Ensure all store listings appear naturally in the main feed but remain visually distinct from regular community items.

🔹 Legal Compliance and Terms Integration

Before a user activates Store Mode, show a Store Owner Terms & Agreement modal explaining responsibilities and compliance requirements.

The agreement should cover:
• Seller responsibility for following local business / food laws
• Platform not liable for product quality or fulfillment
• Accurate stock / price maintenance required
• Fraud or illegal activity = suspension
• Consent to Stripe Terms of Service
• Agreement may be updated → continued use means acceptance
• Seller responsible for applicable taxes

Once accepted, save the user’s agreement details (including date and IP address) and enable Store Mode.

Add a Legal → Agreements section in the profile where owners can review what they accepted.

🔹 Design and Experience

Maintain the existing Grocery Share look and feel.

Use a soft blue tint or badge for store items.

Display “Stock: [x] | $[price]” below each store listing.

Keep layout responsive and mobile-friendly.

Add a Store Mode management area under profile or dashboard for store owners.

🔹 Behavior and Search Logic

Default feed shows nearby items first, mixing both community and store items.

Priority: closest → available → others (by distance).

Exclude out-of-stock store items automatically.

Hide store listings if the owner disables Store Mode.

🔹 Testing and Deployment

Ensure all current features remain fully functional after enhancement.

Show the Terms & Agreement modal only the first time a user activates Store Mode.

Verify tagging, filtering, and search all behave consistently.

When complete, push changes to GitHub so Render (back-end) and Vercel (front-end) redeploy automatically.
