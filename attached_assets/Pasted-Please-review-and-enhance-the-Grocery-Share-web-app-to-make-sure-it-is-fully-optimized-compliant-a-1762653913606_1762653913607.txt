Please review and enhance the Grocery Share web app to make sure it is fully optimized, compliant, and mobile-ready for future iOS/Android app release.

For each of the following items — if it’s already implemented, ensure it meets best-practice and performance standards.
If not implemented, please establish and optimize it now.

1. Backend & API Structure
	•	Verify all routes follow /api/v1 structure and return standardized JSON: { success, data, message }.
	•	Confirm proper async/await usage, centralized error handling, and consistent logging.
	•	Optimize MongoDB queries and add indexes where needed.

2. User Schema & Security
	•	Ensure role, notificationsEnabled, and notificationToken fields exist and function correctly.
	•	Maintain secure token storage, password handling, and JWT expiry management.

3. Frontend Responsiveness
	•	Review all pages for mobile-first design: dashboard, chat, profile, payment, and item list.
	•	Fix any overflow or layout issues for screen widths ≤ 400 px.
	•	Confirm UI consistency (fonts, spacing, buttons, and modals).

4. Privacy & Compliance
	•	Check if Privacy Policy and Terms pages exist; ensure they’re linked in footer and signup/login screens.
	•	Verify “Delete Account” functionality works and follows confirmation flow.
	•	Ensure all API calls use HTTPS and data handling is compliant.

5. Admin Dashboard (CMS)
	•	Validate access control for admin users (role: admin or super_admin).
	•	Confirm ability to update announcements, app text, and basic analytics (total users/items/requests).
	•	Optimize queries for scalability.

6. Payment & Refund Flow
	•	Ensure Stripe integration and refund tracking work smoothly.
	•	Display clear payment status messages and “Powered by Stripe” badge.
	•	Hide or disable buttons for sold/refunded items.

7. Error Handling & Stability
	•	Add or confirm presence of 404 / 500 fallback pages and global error boundaries.
	•	Show proper toast notifications for failed API or network issues.

8. Analytics & Impact Dashboard
	•	If not present, add simple charts or counters for total users, shared items, and food saved.
	•	Optimize for performance and clarity.

9. Branding & Deployment Compatibility
	•	Maintain modern teal & white theme.
	•	Add favicon, meta tags, and Open Graph info.
	•	Ensure compatibility with MongoDB Atlas, Render (backend), and Vercel (frontend) with no breaking changes.

Finally, confirm both Render and Vercel builds deploy successfully after all refinements.
